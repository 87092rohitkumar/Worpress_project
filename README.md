# WordPress Project

This is a WordPress starter project for use with Composer. I'll add more documentation when I can, but it's based heavily off of Mark Jaquith's [WordPress Skeleton](https://github.com/markjaquith/WordPress-Skeleton) project. To get started using it, just use the `create-project` composer command:

```
composer create-project johnpbloch/wordpress-project my-site 0.1.4
```

This will create the project in the `my-site` directory. The project uses `public` as the document root, so make sure to take that into account in your host configurations.

This package is meant to kickstart development of your site. It's probably unwise to use it to deploy a site directly to production.
